## Introduction
The `PasswordController` is a part of the Settings module within a Laravel application. Its primary responsibility is to manage user password settings, allowing users to view their password settings and update their passwords securely. This controller utilizes Inertia.js to render views and provides methods for validating and saving user passwords, ensuring both security and a smooth user experience.

## Methods

### edit()
#### Purpose
The `edit` method displays the user's password settings page.

#### Parameters
This method does not accept any parameters.

#### Return Value
- Returns an `Inertia\Response` object, which is responsible for rendering the `settings/password` view.

#### Functionality
This method serves a simple role in the password management process:
- It utilizes the Inertia.js library to render the password settings page. This allows smooth navigation and reactive user interface updates.
- The view rendered is assumed to be located at `resources/js/Pages/settings/password.vue`, which contains the front-end implementation for managing passwords.

```php
public function edit(): Response
{
    return Inertia::render('settings/password');
}
```

### update(Request $request)
#### Purpose
The `update` method is responsible for updating the user's password.

#### Parameters
- **Request** `$request`: The HTTP request object that contains the data input by the user, including the current and new passwords.

#### Return Value
- Returns a `RedirectResponse`, redirecting the user back to the previous location after processing the password update.

#### Functionality
The `update` method performs several critical tasks:
1. **Validation**: It validates the incoming request data to ensure the following:
   - `current_password`: This field is required and must match the user's actual current password.
   - `password`: This field is required, must follow default password rules (defined by Laravel), and should be confirmed via a matching input (it requires a field named `password_confirmation` to be present in the request).

2. **Password Update**:
   - Once validated, it updates the user's password by hashing the new password using Laravel's `Hash` facade.

3. **Redirection**: The method redirects the user back to where they came from, indicating that the update process was completed.

The security model enforced here ensures that users can only change their passwords by confirming their current password, hence minimizing the risk of unauthorized password changes.

```php
public function update(Request $request): RedirectResponse
{
    $validated = $request->validate([
        'current_password' => ['required', 'current_password'],
        'password' => ['required', Password::defaults(), 'confirmed'],
    ]);

    $request->user()->update([
        'password' => Hash::make($validated['password']),
    ]);

    return back();
}
```

---

## Routes
The `PasswordController` is associated with the following routes, typically defined in the `web.php` file of the Laravel application:

| HTTP Method | URI                        | Action                    |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| GET         | `/settings/password`       | `edit`                    |
| POST        | `/settings/password`       | `update`                  |

### Route Definitions
- **GET /settings/password**
  - Maps to the `edit` method to render the password settings page.
  
- **POST /settings/password**
  - Maps to the `update` method to handle password update submissions.
