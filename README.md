## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlpetGexha/ai-playground
cd ai-playground
cp .env.example .env
composer install
php artisan key:generate
npm install
```

Becuse the OpenAI requires to use the SSL (https), you need to install the SSL certificate manuily.

Or u can use the **Herd**

in your project directory, run:

```bash
herd link
herd secure
```

Add the key to your `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=your_organization_id_here
```

## Project Structure

Key directories and files:

- `app/Http/Controllers/AI/`: Contains controllers for all AI features
- `app/Agents/`: Houses the specialized AI agents for different platforms
- `app/Services/`: Contains the ChatAI service and other utility services
- `resources/js/pages/`: React components for each page of the application
- `routes/web.php`: Defines all web routes for accessing features
- `config/openai.php`: Configuration for OpenAI integration

## Security Considerations

- The application stores API keys in the `.env` file (never commit this to public repositories)
- Implement proper user authentication to restrict access to AI features
- Consider implementing rate limiting for API requests to control costs

## Understanding AI Roles

The application uses three primary roles in AI interactions:

- **System**: Defines the behavior and parameters of the AI assistant
- **User**: Represents input from the human user
- **Assistant**: Represents responses from the AI
