## Available Commands

### Social Media Optimizer

This command guides you through creating optimized social media content for multiple platforms.

```bash
php artisan social:optimize:v2
```

Options:

- `--monitor`: Enable monitoring of agent activity
- `--compact`: Run in compact mode with fewer tokens (reduces API usage)
- `--target=8`: Target score to achieve (1-10)
- `--attempts=3`: Maximum optimization attempts
- `--cache`: Use cached results when possible
- `--save --markdown`: Output in Markdown format

### Business Settings Management

Update your business information used by the social media optimization agents:

```bash
php artisan business:update
```

View your current business settings:

```bash
php artisan business:show
```

## How It Works

The system uses a multi-agent approach:

1. **Controller Agent:** Coordinates between specialized platform agents
2. **Platform-Specific Agents:**
   - **Facebook Agent:** Optimizes content for Facebook's algorithm and audience
   - **Instagram Agent:** Optimizes content for Instagram's visual-first approach
3. **Analytics Agent:** Analyzes content for engagement potential using structured JSON format
4. **Content Optimizer Agent:** Refines content based on analytics feedback

## Analytics JSON Format

The system uses a structured JSON format for analytics feedback:

```json
{
  "engagementAnalysis": {
    "platform": "Facebook",
    "engagementScore": 8,
    "strengths": [
      "Clear call to action",
      "Effective use of hashtags"
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Add more emotional appeal",
      "Include a question to drive engagement"
    ]
  }
}
```

This structured format enables precise optimization in feedback loops.

## Example Usage

1. Set up your business information:

   ```bash
   php artisan business:update
   ```

2. Run the social media optimizer with optimization options:

   ```bash
   # Standard usage
   php artisan social:optimize:v2

   # For minimal token usage (efficient mode)
   php artisan social:optimize:v2 --compact --target=8 --attempts=2 --cache
   ```

   This version does direct agent calls with feedback loops to continuously improve content quality.

3. Follow the interactive prompts to create your content.

4. Receive platform-optimized content ready to post on each platform.

## Configuration

Update your business details in the `.env` file:

```env
BUSINESS_NAME="Hotel Driada"
BUSINESS_PHONE="+383 44 567 631"
BUSINESS_LOCATION="Pika e Zez, Gjakove"
BUSINESS_TYPE=hotel_restaurant
BUSINESS_DESCRIPTION="A beautiful hotel and restaurant offering excellent accommodation and dining experience."
BUSINESS_FACEBOOK=""
BUSINESS_INSTAGRAM=""
```

Or use the command to update these settings:

```bash
php artisan business:update
```

## Token Usage Optimization

To minimize token usage (API costs), the system provides several options:

- **Compact Mode:** Use the `--compact` flag for shorter prompts and responses
- **Caching:** Enable the `--cache` option to reuse analytics results when possible
- **Target Score:** Set a lower target score (e.g., `--target=7`) for fewer optimization cycles
- **Max Attempts:** Limit optimization attempts with `--attempts=2` to cap token usage

This can reduce token consumption by 40-60% while maintaining good optimization quality.
